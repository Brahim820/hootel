# ALDA PROJECT MODULES

UNDER DEVELOPMENT: **NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**


**IMPORTANT:**
  - Set time zone of users that use the calendar

**MODULES:**
  - hotel: Base module (a fork of SerpentCS Hotel Module)
  - hotel_calendar: Adds calendar for manage hotel reservations and rooms configuration
  - hotel_calendar_wubook: Unify 'hotel_wubook_prototype' and 'hotel_calendar' modules
  - hotel_l10n_es: Procedures for check-in process in Spain
  - hotel_wubook: NOTHING... the idea is use Odoo Connector
  - hotel_wubook_prototype: Current implementation of Wubook Connector... sync data with wubook.net account.
  - hotel_node_slave: Configure a node as a slave to serve and get information from a master one
  - glassof_exporter: Export Odoo data to Glassof xls format

**HOW WORKS?**
  - The idea is... the hotel sell 'virtual rooms' and the customer is assigned to one 'normal room'.
  - The folio have all reservation lines, used services...
